 * AWS credential resolution for Bedrock, in two modes.
 *
 * static  — the connection carries the keys: `apiKey` is the AWS secret access key,
 *           `providerSpecificData.accessKeyId` the key id, and `providerSpecificData.sessionToken`
 *           is set when they came from STS. Nothing is refreshable; when temporary keys expire the
 *           user must paste new ones.
 *
 * profile — the connection names a local AWS profile and nothing else. Credentials are resolved
 *           through the AWS SDK, which is what makes `aws sso login --profile X` work: the SDK
 *           reads ~/.aws/config, follows `sso_session`, reads the token from ~/.aws/sso/cache,
 *           calls GetRoleCredentials, and handles source_profile/role chaining. Re-resolving
 *           after expiry gives us refresh for free.
 *
 * The SDK is imported lazily so static-key users never pay for it, and so a missing optional
 * dependency produces an actionable error instead of breaking module load for every provider.
